2020-12-14,B0CPSSKZXQ,5,"This speaker offers a great value for money. For the money you pay , the speaker offers brilliant build quality with an excellent sound. The speaker is feature loaded with 5 different modes to offer ( AUX, FM, TF Card, Call Receiving & TWS) and has an amazing battery life. It is an overall package. The audio quality offers good treble and mid range while Bass is still manageable considering the overall output. The Audio clarity also depends on the source you are playing and the difference is quite obvious when I streamed audio from Amazon Music and Spotify and playing the MP3s stored on my phone. The streaming audio quality was fluctuating when compared to playing MP3s but still very good.Audio Quality: 4.5/5 ( Mids and Trebles are good, BASS is decent )Audio Output: 5/5 ( Sufficient output for small hall and for large bedrooms. Couldn't hear much distortions even at highest volume)Build Quality: 5/5Design: 5/5 ( P.S: The fabric  outer covering is of good quality but may get dirty)Battery Life: 5/5 ( Played Songs for 8 Hours at an average of 40-50% volume continuously and battery indicator was still showing 80%. I think I can extend it beyond 16 Hours easily)Connectivity: 4/5 within 10 meters distancePros: Build Quality/ Battery Life/ Design/ Audio Quality/ Audio Output/FeaturesCons: Tuning FM is a task but once tuned, it works like a piece of cake/ Loud Irritating menu sounds especially when turning the speaker on and blue tooth pairing.",R33155836WHWL8,5,A very good speaker with great value for money,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R33155836WHWL8?ASIN=B0CPSSKZXQ,1813,564,Colour: Stone GreyStyle Name: Vibe
2021-08-07,B0CPSSKZXQ,5,"I am not gonna make you guys read a big paragraph, instead I am listing the performance of this cute little beast down below for you to get an idea.- Sound quality = 9/10 (Slight distortion when volume is at 100, but at the levels of 80-85, it's magic)- Treble = 9/10- Bass = 10/10 (It's amazing for its size and the bass is punchy. So don't expect the bass to be similar to boom boxes or other big speakers)- Battery life = 10/10 (Takes a while to charge though. But completely worth it for the standby time it provides)- Portability = 10/10- Toughness = 10/10 (Already dropped couple of times from atleast 5 feet high. Also water resistance is outstanding)- Connectivity = 10/10 (Super fast connectivity without seamless latency)- Build Quality - 10/10 (Premium to the core)So to sum it up, if you are looking for a decent Bluetooth speaker which can vibe a room go for this monster. You can always tweak Equalizer in your device to adjust the bass and treble according to your liking. The speaker is so adjustable and gives the desired sound output. Overall my experience with the speaker with one month of usage is speachless. #Vibe",R2SUIZM66ZJNLD,2,Absolute allrounder,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2SUIZM66ZJNLD?ASIN=B0CPSSKZXQ,1813,564,Colour: Midnight BlackStyle Name: Vibe

2020-12-13,B0CPSSKZXQ,5,"I fairly took 4 days before coming to a conclusion. Read carefully.Noise vibe 5w is awesome piece for the features it offers in price range.A quick comparison with portronics vibe (8 W) & zakk lounge (10W) because all are priced at 1400 rs approx :Portronics vibe was launched way back in October 2018, it's a feature packed 8W speaker have all features including FM, it is still a best choice for pure sould listeners, it doesn't offer boosted bass, but has more balanced sound with clear instrument separation.Zakk lounge is a 10W speaker at 1400rs, it has sd slot but not FM. I can fairly say this speaker beats a 2.1 system in loudness of audio, sometimes feels like a 20 w speaker. If someone wants loud sound and can compromise on portability, this is the best speaker on amazon at present because it runs on 7.4 V battery instead of 3.7V, no other 10 W speaker on 3.7 V come close to this. I rarely charge this speaker, because of it's monster battery inside. It has no competition in 10W speaker range. One can blindly go for it.Among all speakers, for clear sound i will choose portronics vibe over others. That doesn't mean others are not good.Noise speaker has best build among all, i couldn't find any 1300 rs speaker with such an amazing built. Overall this is the best 5w speaker available in market right now. It's loudness is similar to portronics 8w speaker.For more loud sound listeners zakk lounge is clear winner among all.

2020-12-22,B0CPSSKZXQ,5,"Very satisfied with the product. It has weight to it and is very sturdy as well. I am a musician and I can say with confidence that this has a balanced sound. The bass is sufficient enough for the small size. It doesn’t take a genius to know that there’s only so much a 1,200/300 speaker can dish out. I’d say there’s honestly no other speaker which has impressed me as much as the VIBE 5W in this price range. The battery is good and the design is very very aesthetically pleasing.Summary- “JUST GO FOR IT!!”P.s. a personal feedback to the good people at NOISE.

2024-02-16,B0B51CFSC3,1,"Title: Disappointing Experience with Noise Buds 402**Introduction:**As an avid music lover and frequent user of earbuds, I was excited to try out the Noise Buds 402. However, my experience with these earbuds left much to be desired.**Product Overview:**The Noise Buds 402 are marketed as affordable wireless earbuds with decent sound quality and convenient features such as touch controls and a compact charging case.**Specific Issues Encountered:**Unfortunately, I encountered several issues with these earbuds that made using them a frustrating experience.**Sound Quality:**The sound quality of the Noise Buds 402 is subpar at best. Despite claims of clear and crisp audio, I found the sound to be muffled and lacking in detail. The bass was particularly weak, making music sound flat and unexciting.**Build Quality:**The build quality of the earbuds themselves also left much to be desired. They felt cheaply made and flimsy, with the plastic casing showing signs of wear after only a few uses. Additionally, the earbuds would occasionally disconnect from each other, disrupting my listening experience.**Battery Life:**While the battery life of the Noise Buds 402 is decent, lasting around 4-5 hours on a single charge, it falls short of the advertised 6-hour battery life. Moreover, the charging case provided only one additional charge, limiting the overall usage time when on the go.**Connectivity Issues:**I experienced frequent connectivity issues with these earbuds, with the Bluetooth connection dropping out intermittently, even when my device was in close proximity. This made it impossible to enjoy music or take calls without constant interruptions.**Conclusion:**In conclusion, I cannot recommend the Noise Buds 402 to others based on my experience. The subpar sound quality, flimsy build, short battery life, and connectivity issues make these earbuds a poor investment. I would advise potential buyers to look elsewhere for a more reliable and higher-quality buds any Brand,, Money Never comes Easley,,,,",R1ZXINLJB8V1ES,28,"its very cheep quality Technicalities, its not worthy of money its suitable for  RS 599/- Only",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZXINLJB8V1ES?ASIN=B0B51CFSC3,10973,3648,Colour: Neon WhiteStyle Name: Buds VS402

2022-12-04,B0B9788XQ2,5,"So it’s been a day since I’ve started using these and these are the ratings I’m giving them:Overall Sound Quality: 9/10Call Quality: 9/10Bass: 9/10Mids: 9/10Trebles: 8/10Comfort: 7/10Portability: 10/10Looks: 9/10Packaging: 9/10Touch Controls: 8/10And here are some of the pros and cons I found out:Pros: 1. The battery life on these seem to be pretty good cause after using them for around 5 hours the still had 30% left, however since I’ve been using them for a day I don’t know how  long the charging case would last with a full charge. 2. They look absolutely amazing. The simplistic design makes them stand out even more. Do keep in mind the fact that they sort of look similar to the Apple AirPods(3rd generation) bud are also unique in their own way. 3. The unboxing experience was also very satisfactory, as if I was unboxing some weird-named expensive earbuds. 4. They sound pretty decent and crisp, with a ton of bass. So yes, bass lovers can consider this as an option. 5. They have a dedicated reset button which is way better than having to “long press” both earbuds to reset them. 6. As these require no rubber ear tips for use, a major concern of mine has been solved: losing the ear tips. 7. The calling experience I had with these was 10/10. I could hear the other person very well, with them being able to hear me clearly, thanks to the quad mic setup with ENC.Cons: 1. Even though I’m happy with the fact that they don’t have rubber ear tips, the lack of the same results in reduced comfort. While I was listening to my playlist, my ears started to hurt just a few songs in. 2. Due to the matte finish on the earbuds case, they get scratches very easily which appears more prominent in certain angles.

2023-06-09,B0B9788XQ2,1,"This is my first noise purchase and I was first very happy with the product. Audio quality is super and everything but the issue is that the battery life of left bud is less than the right. Once charged full and taken out together of the pod, the left always drains out and the right one still has around 30 percent left. I will try and reach out for replacementEdit: I got the replacement after 7+ days. Now both the buds have their own Bluetooth signal. You can choose if you want to connect with left bud or right but can't have both working at the same time. Called noise support at 6.15 (they close at 6.30) but their recorded message indicated that I called after their office hours. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AND STRESSFUL EXPERIENCEEDIT (After 5 months of experience): The issue with connectivity was resolved after reset. However after 5 months of use, the buds do not charge above 80% no matter what you do. The pod is left to charge for more than 11 hours. I assume that the pod is 100% charged but when you take out buds even after leaving them in the pod overnight, they are never above 80%.

2023-06-04,B0B9788XQ2,5,"So, I'm particularly someone who loves all types of half-in earbuds and dislikes the in-ear earbuds, my ears are sensitive to it(it pains for me). So I bought this for around 1099(while on offer). I love the color and the main reason why I bought it. The sound quality is amazing, normally with half-in earbuds the sound quality is lower then in-earbuds, but this one's completely not it. Everything sounds crisp for the price tag it came. The bass really surprised me because its quite better than expected. The battery is quite long lasting goes on for multiple days. The fit overall is good doesn't feel like its gonna fall of or something. Overall this are quite good for the price, very pocket friendly, you can get it in black or white too. One thing i would like to add is that its not completely noise cancelling.

2022-10-15,B0B9788XQ2,4,"My first impressions: Overall the packaging quality looked professional. On opening the box, you’re greeted with a welcome card along with a warranty registration & couple of decent stickers which you can see in the above attached photos. They have used good quality of plastics in the product. The outer charging case looks sleek & stylish, almost like a pebble stone. It definitely scores high on aesthetics. It gives an impression of AirPods at first look but yet looks distinct.Fitting: Since it’s an open fit design, it sits comfortably in the ear. I had no issue of them falling out from ears with rigorous head shakes. The ear buds are quite light in weight so a complete thumbs-up for that.Music: Noise Buds Pro come with 14.3mm sound drivers which are good enough for an open fit earphone like this. Music sounds slightly flat, but they don’t crack at large volumes. Can’t expect more at this price point. The touch controls on both the buds are very sensitive & they function quite efficiently.Calls: I initially tried recording voice memos with these buds, but the sound captured was low, so had to increase my volume to hear it while Play-backing the notes. The quad mics & noise cancellation feature  cancels the external sounds but makes the voice isolated. At this price point, don’t expect too much. You’ll have to speak a bit louder for the other person to hear your voice clearly. So far have used it once in Zoom call, and the other side could hear me decently. So no complaints on that front. I’m still using the product so these are first impressions only. Haven’t tried it outside on noisy places.Battery: With full charge, I could get around 5.5 hours of playback time. And with 5 mins of charge gave 90 mins of playback time.Latency: I’m using this product with an iPhone, so the Bluetooth connectivity is quite good. I didn’t witness any lag in the videos or music played so far. Also the connection is stable because of Bluetooth 5.3.These are my honest comments on using the product from last 3 days. If you’re looking for a budget, open-fit earphone for movies & music, you can definitely go for it. Not that impressive for office calls  It has good looks for sure, has a cute case which you would love to carry & gives an impression of an expensive brand. I really appreciate the efforts taken by Noise Brand to design such value-for-money, stylish & technologically efficient products to masses.",RVHG8AZ9SUPD7,76,This was a pleasant surprise.

2021-08-19,B092ZFV1FC,5,"At first i was kinda skeptical when i read about the reviews saying the buds had “inadequate bass” and I can say you the buds have decent enough bass. I listen to bass-heavy songs all the time and this buds have okayish bass (compared to previous gen AirBuds). If your prefer bass-rich songs you’ll be a bit disappointed. The form factor is the main reason I considered this buds. The mids and highs are very clear. Perfect for those who enjoy casual listening. The Call quality is above average. Battery life is enough but could’ve been better consider the competition offers almost 2hrs more on buds and 4-8 hrs more on the charging case. The buds are comfortable and provides good noise isolation. Hypersync is actually good at first i thought it was a gimmick but when i compared with the previous gen model the buds connects fast (could say it rivals AirPods and the lid snaps like one too). The quick charge is really convenient aswell!Audio Quality 9/10Bass 7/10Form factor 10/10Connectivity 9/10Battery life 8/10Comfort 9/10Noise isolation 9/10Build quality 9/10Design 10/10 (looks and feels premium)Water resistance 8/10 (could’ve been waterproof)Verdict- The headphones provide premium audio experience and has good build and design.

2021-12-14,B092ZFV1FC,1,"I hope you'll find my review helpful if you haven't purchased this item otherwise you'll get to know within a month anyway so good luck if you want to purchase this.I'm very much surprised that within a month, one of the Air Buds just stopped working!!!!At this price point, practically I didn't even expect for it to work or have high functionalities as Apple Airpods but if the item just stops working within a month then there's something fundamentally wrong with it.As you can see from the video, when I try to pair my Air Buds+ with my mobile, only one gets paired (blinking LED) and the other one, simply doesn't blink at all! This video was taken after resetting the Air Buds+ and unpaid from all the Bluetooth connected devices so the resetting clearly didn't work.Except for this issue, I must say that the product is very good at this price range. Sound quality and noise cancellation is also good. I usually use it for zoom meetings and have no issues in connectivity or speakers and microphones.Also, sometimes when these Air Buds are at around 30% battery, the flow of the sound goes like stereo automatically and makes infinity ♾️ sound pattern in your head.Company provides you 1 year warranty so it's up to you if you want to get it repaired and still hope it won't stop working after a month or so.I contacted their customer care and they clearly mentioned that after they check your item, if the item is not working at all, the company will replace the unit but they didn't clarify that they will replace it with another used/refurbished one so please be mindful before buying this.[Update: 26 May, 2022] : After 6 months of usage, I found that the used replacement that the company sent to me is still buzzing constantly in the right Air Bud. Also, both the Air Buds gets disconnected automatically anytime.After this incident, I will never buy any Noise product in the future nor will recommend anyone in my circle.[Update: 5 June, 2022] : Things are getting worse. I've used this for several zoom and skype calls and the othmicrophone is not working properly. Whatever you will say, your meeting participants will not be able to hear clearly as your voice will keep breaking. Also, suddenly it turns off or gets disconnected from your laptop or mobile anytime.I will keep using this occasionally to check how long it will last!

They lack in bass, if you like to listen rock music with good bass, you might not like them. They provide good balanced sound with 95~98% noise cancellation.2. Touch can be little bit more smooth.

2022-01-07,B092ZFV1FC,1,"Pros - Sleek & Small in size.Cons - Many mentioned below.Earpod playback time of 20 hrs - Noise has marketed this product claiming 20hrs of playback time. I've used this product at 100% battery twice and each time it didn't last longer than 5-6 hrs of being connected with intermittent playback. Either the product I've rcvd is faulty or you guys are giving out false info for marketing purposes.P.S. - I did order a replacement of this product and the 2nd one had the exact same performance. Look at the snapshots attached that show the battery draining down to 60% in 2.5 hrs of playback time. Somebody should sue their asses for false marketting.Bluetooth range - They also claim Bluetooth range of 10 mtrs without any obstructions but in reality the one I have barely works beyond 4 mtrs.No Noise Cancellation - These also don't have any noise cancellation at all. In fact, surrounding noise is amplified. So this product is not worth it at all for this price.Customer Service - None available on their support line. All you get is an IVR that sends you an SMS with a self help link taking you back to the website. Half the things don't work on their website.Poor Website response - When registering the complaint, it's not accepting Invoice snapshot upload of <300 kb whereas the limit is 5Mb.

The sound quality at this rate is undebatable (though initially you'd find the quality to be a bit too crisp which I disliked) but the bass was a big letdown. I was expecting it to be something of similar bass like BoAt's since both are quite budget-friendly but, looks like that was a huge miss for me.

2024-08-01,B0CQJWQWD9,4,"I bought the Noise Buds N1 in-Ear Truly Wireless Earbuds with Chrome Finish, probably a week ago and here is an overall review of how they are. Here are some of my thoughts:Pros:Build Quality: These look so rad in silver chrome and feels durable too. They are designed to fit snugly in the ear so they never fall out during movement.Sound Quality : Sound quality is pretty good, Audio output is clear and Bass seems to be really neat. It did fine in the testing with good results for clearing calls over the noise on other end thanks to Quad Mic and ENC helping here.Battery Life - 40-hour playtime gives me the best value without having to recharge, further letting my earbuds work all day. The Instacharge feature is a nice addition as well, catering towards fast charging if in case you need to.Connectivity: The BT v5.3 ensures a stable connection with minimal latency, making these earbuds great for watching videos or playing games.Drawbacks of these areCons: Fit for Long Use: These would be comfortable to use in the short term but extended usage could feel slightly uncomfortable Has A Play button stands out at each earphone section This is likely just personal preference, though.Volume: Max volume is a bit quieter than we'd prefer. Although it does work perfectly well for the most part, some users may find that they need a little more in very noisy environments. In conclusion, the Noise Buds N1 are very well priced and for that price tag, you get a lot of features and decent performance. I have and would continue to recommend this product as a solid, reliable pair of wireless earbuds.",RGV2CVMLNFZBE,5,good experience,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RGV2CVMLNFZBE?ASIN=B0CQJWQWD9,9168,5309,Colour: Green

Here are my thoughts:**Sound Quality:** The sound quality is decent, providing clear and balanced audio. Whether it's for music, calls, or podcasts, the earbuds perform well across various audio formats.**Fit:** The fit of the earbuds is also good. They are comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing any discomfort, making them ideal for daily use.**Connectivity:** One of the standout features is the fast connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with devices is quick and seamless, ensuring a hassle-free experience.**Build Quality:** The only downside I found is the build quality of the case. It could be improved to match the overall quality of the earbuds themselves. The case feels a bit flimsy and could use a more robust construction.**Conclusion:** Despite the minor issue with the case, the Earbuds N1 are a great choice with good sound quality, comfortable fit, fast connectivity, and a useful gaming mode.

Even at 50-60% volume, it feels a lot.Bass (3.5/5): You can feel the vibrations in some cases when the bass is too high. But generally, it wont affect much.Audio Clarity (4/5): Audio clarity is good. You can hear the words clearly.Comfort (3/5): The buds fit in but the there is a slight discomfort for some days. It's still taking time for me to be used to it.Noise Cancellation (4/5): I have used these in gyms, at 50% volume there is not much noise cancellation. But as you go with higher volume, noise cancellation works in.Mic (3/5): Little annoying tbh. On whatsapp calls or in public, you will have to speak a bit lowder. But on normal calls, voice is clear to the other person.Charging (4/5): Charged it once when it arrived and till now i don't there has been a need to charge it again. They could have given a way to see how much battery of case is remaining.Overall (3.9/5): I have been using this for 4-5 days and purchased this for 999.

(But It will work for me)CASE- (Plastic body) comes with Matt finished, size- medium like niether big nor small... I personally don't like the VS103 case... But this case is pretty good.So atlast If you guys have also got this in ₹895/-or even in ₹999 I think it's a good deal... But currently these are showing the price ₹1719 which is somewhat expensive because in this price range other TWS like oppo enco buds which is currently of ₹1800 which I thinks a better option because they are like all rounder...So the choice is yours ...For me this is the best option... Because first of all i really use buds for like 1-2hr in a day just for music only ... If I am in home i just prefer to watch movies or series without buds... Only if I am outside then I will use them for movies or series...I hope my review will help you guys ... I tried to keep it short but failed haha ...",R2XES5SVJG8YP1,926,BUDGET TWS,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2XES5SVJG8YP1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Y5MK1KB,28221,9794,Colour: Snow White

2024-01-13,B0C24KBK24,3,"I've been using these buds on a daily basis for the past 8 months now and here's my honest review:1. Sound quality - Decent for the price range, but not impressive out of the box. Had to tinker around with EQ settings a lot before they sounded good. The highs and bass are acceptable but the mids are not impressive at all. So the sound signature is pretty average. The volume is sufficient and if you manage to get a good fit, it will drown much of the outside noise.2. Battery backup - pretty good. Lasts a week for the case and buds have given me 6-7 hrs max on low latency mode.3. Build quality - This leaves me unimpressed as the case is a scratch magnet and the logo will fade within a month if you store it in your backpack or even your pocket. Even the buds get scratched eventually due to the sliding case mechanism. But this doesn't affect the functioning of the buds in any way, just the aesthetic.4. Ergonomics - Good enough for the price range5. Connectivity - Easy and simple. Connects quickly each time once pairing is complete and call quality and clarity is also pretty good.6. Price - justified to a certain extent. But you can always add a bit more and go for something just a bit better if you're upgrading from something older. If this is your first tws, then you can definitely get one and experience the use case before upgrading.Overall rating - Solid 3/5",R2ZSPOVO4RP7DT,62,Practical review after 8 months of use,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZSPOVO4RP7DT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C24KBK24,10973,3648,Colour: Neon BlackStyle Name: Buds VS402

2023-02-22,B0B9788XQ2,4,"I ordered the airbuds in October 2022. So far they have been great. They are very good in fiting. Good for working out, cycling, travelling (I don't prefer while traveling, drive safe). You can't expect a lot from 14mm drivers tbh. The buds play some songs good and some songs bad. The hypersync is the king here. 2.30 secs connecting time is just really impressive. You buds connect to you phone before you wear both of the buds. The only issues I faced are. Somethings while traveling the song just cracks. Like it sounds like someone is using a emf( Electro Magnetic Force Machine) to disturb the signal. And also it says it has 10m connectivity, but I doesn't seem that much. I have used Zebronics Duke Headphones for 2 years. And I would keep my phone on my desk in my bedroom and just walk out in to the hall to grab charger or whatever and come back and the song will be still playing without any issue and crack. But this is not the case with the airbuds. Both have 10m range. So these are only 2 problem faced by me.

This product is perfect for my ears and also build is good with no uneven shapes or difficulty to handle.Connectivity: 8/10 - I had issues connecting at first but it was just a first-time hassle, once you are connected with your phone.

There are 3 things which I find could be better. 1. The ear fit could have been better. It's not a perfect fit. High chances of falling off earbuds when running or in a crowded place. 2. The case design and quality could have so much more. The always closing of the lid is an issue and there is no gap for easy opening of the lid with one hand. 3.

2024-07-20,B0CFYCDDX1,5,The noise x prime buds are so good and comfort and it is so beautiful look wise I am happy the sound is awesome and it connects so easily by opening it so good product,R10NYQ3YCYSL4W,0,Noise x prime,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R10NYQ3YCYSL4W?ASIN=B0CFYCDDX1,1901,666,Colour: White
2024-07-18,B0CFYCDDX1,1,"I recently purchased the Noise Buds X Prime, hoping to enjoy high-quality sound and a seamless wireless experience. Unfortunately, my experience has been quite disappointing, and here's why:Sound QualityThe most significant drawback of these earbuds is the sound quality. The audio output is subpar, lacking clarity and depth. The bass is weak, the mids are muddled, and the highs are harsh, making it difficult to enjoy any genre of music. Whether it's listening to music, watching videos, or taking calls, the audio performance is consistently underwhelming.Connectivity IssuesAnother major issue is the connectivity. Despite being advertised as truly wireless, the earbuds often struggle to maintain a stable connection with my device. There are frequent drops in the connection, and sometimes, one earbud disconnects while the other continues to play. This inconsistency is frustrating, especially during calls or while listening to music.Comfort and FitThe fit and comfort of the Noise Buds X Prime are also lacking. They tend to fall out easily, even with minimal movement, and wearing them for extended periods becomes uncomfortable. The earbuds don't provide a secure fit, which is crucial for both sound quality and convenience.Battery LifeBattery life is another area where these earbuds fall short. Despite claims of long-lasting battery life, I found myself needing to recharge them more frequently than expected. The battery drains quickly, particularly when using them for calls or streaming music.Build QualityThe build quality of the Noise Buds X Prime feels cheap and flimsy. The charging case and the earbuds themselves are made of low-quality plastic that doesn't inspire confidence in their durability. Additionally, the touch controls on the earbuds are not very responsive, making it difficult to control playback and volume.ConclusionOverall, the Noise Buds X Prime in-Ear Truly Wireless Earbuds fail to deliver on their promises. With poor sound quality, unreliable connectivity, uncomfortable fit, disappointing battery life, and low build quality, they do not offer good value for money. I would not recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a reliable and high-quality wireless audio experience.",R1YJLSPBB2QXHK,2,"my experience has been quite disappointing, and here's why:",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1YJLSPBB2QXHK?ASIN=B0CFYCDDX1,1901,666,Colour: Gray

2024-03-12,B0CMTWPKCJ,5,"The FIRST and primary features is the microphone. The other person in line can hear my voice crystal clear and without any background noise. (Most of the bluetooth headphones have unpleasant background noise and with the person on the other end not hearing us properly )SECONDLY,  the battery back up is incredible.  It can last a day with frequent use and lose only about 10%-20% of the total capacity.THIRDLY,  the buttons are placed distinctly and protruding,  which makes it very convenient. (Yes flat buttons are confusing and we tend to press the wrong ones)FOURTH point is that the bass quality is pretty good.Other advantages includes good quality plastic and wire material, even the ear plugs are soft and comfortable. The magnet also works well and the bluetooth doesn't get disconnected even when they gets attached. (some bluetooth gets disconnected when the magnet gets attached or kept un used for a while, which i find it very inconvenient)The ONLY DISADVANTAGE i find is that even the lowest volume is loud for me, especially while using it at night or when your surrounding is calm.",R1DENI9RMX81LV,15,Simply Amazing,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1DENI9RMX81LV?ASIN=B0CMTWPKCJ,17335,6027,Colour: Black
2021-03-07,B0CMTWPKCJ,4,"I actually purchased this product as I was tight on budget. I searched for a lot of neckbands and bought this. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:1. The build quality and look of the neckband feels premium and durable compared to Mivi collar 22. Sound quality is quite good..it gets loud enough but not too loud. Bass is on point and overall you get a very well balanced sound quality.3. The battery life is simply amazing. It lasts for about 3 days and my usage is 3-4 hours per day.4. It has a Qualcomm chipset which is okayish for this price point. Noice cancellation is also average.5. It supports dual pairing- this means that you can connect upto 2 devices with this neckband and the audio switches automatically as you go from one device to another (however I noticed a delay of 2-3 seconds).6. Mic quality is good enough. The other person can hear clearly.Cons:1. You do not get AptX or AptX HD. For those who don’t know these are Bluetooth audio codecs. You can google it out and see which audio codecs does your phone support. If you are an iPhone user like me then you can use this as iPhone only supports AAC codec.2. You do not get a thumping bass. So for bass lovers I do not recommend this. If you like a more balanced and crisp sound then go for it.3. Latency - as it does not have AptX HD so it has latency while gaming compared to Boat rockerz 335 and OnePlus wireless buds (YouTube, prime, netflix works fine)4. It has micro usb port. This product was launched in 2020 but still has a micro usb port instead of a type C.5. There is a hissing sound continuously on this and boat rockerz which I did not notice on mivi collar 2Conclusion: Well if the pros and cons did not help you out then here are my final thoughts on this. If you are someone who likes to listen to a lot of music and not overwhelming bass then this product is really good. The battery life is great you get atleast 10 hours of battery on 80-90% volume. It’s not for gaming so don’t buy it just for gaming purpose.",R10DLA3Z4GELO0,17,A well balanced wireless earphones,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R10DLA3Z4GELO0?ASIN=B0CMTWPKCJ,17335,6027,Colour: Jet Black

The only exception is that when order reaches from other city then it takes 4 to 5 days, which as per the usual process considerableBox Content:- it comes with noise registration leaflet, manual, micro usb cable, extra pair of earbudsConnectivity:-Its perfect but lags somehow, its hard to proceed far away. Mainly it depends on obstacles how it works.Battery:- i haven't charged it since the day product arrived and with mixed usage, battery level not yet reduced despite of mixed and moderate use. And still manage to be at 80%.Sound quality:-Considering the price point, audio is just perfectly balanced the good point is its a blend of perfect tuning. Seperation of instruments and vocal can be easily identified. In short music lovers will start loving it, apart from that extra bass is just gimmick. Else its brilliant and produce best sound, songs feels bit low and average in normal mode but when turn to extra bass mode then the sound accompanied by bass. In short its sound and audio is just perfect for what is right, balanced thats what made it so different. Trust me i was skeptical and i returned 6 to 7 earphones and headphones just because they have not met my expectations but it stands on my expectations, brilliant work.Cons:-Bass:-To remind that functional button is there change the mode from normal to extra bass, its just a gimmick and need a thoughtful touch before introducing it.it doesn't work that way they condemn it.Build quality:- no doubt its perfect, but its earbuds are quite old fashioned, design is just overtly laid which were downside and i don't like that much.Noise cancellation:- There is no reduction of noise however its one bad aspect considering the price pointsEar buds:- Doesn't fit well in my ears, its not that they came but it seems to be loosened and noise could have given in ear design,metal housing is not there, and earbuds were overtly designed, its modern trend to have in ear design which fits perfect and it lacks these qualitiesConclusionbought these neckband although this could be premium and stay around for a while, to say its premium and classy but can't beat boat rockers 255 in terms of bass. Apart from bass its perfect comparing to boat rockers, dont know about the durability,  At first glance these neckbands are show stealers.

2024-07-05,B0CMTXW7JP,1,"I purchased the Noise Airwave Neckband Earphones two months ago, expecting decent quality and performance. Unfortunately, my experience has been quite the opposite.Firstly, the build quality is extremely poor. In just two months, the right side of the earphones is completely damaged, with wires visibly sticking out. This is unacceptable for a product that's supposed to be durable.Secondly, the advertised noise cancellation is non-existent. There is constant disturbance while making calls, making it difficult to communicate. This defeats the primary purpose of having such earphones.Additionally, I had purchased a 2-year warranty from Amazon, hoping for some peace of mind. However, the service from Amazon has been disappointing as well. Despite multiple attempts to seek help, I received no assistance from their team. The lack of options and support has made this entire experience frustrating.Overall, these earphones have been a total waste of money.

2024-05-12,B0CY2377YW,4,Whenever I buy something online I spend a lot of time researching the pros and cons of the product. Before buying Noise Three I compared it with almost every other product in the price range of 2000 and it was looking promising. The only problem is the Auxiliary mode which doesn't seem to work properly in my case. The 3.5 mm cables are not working properly as only the left side produces audio but distortedly. Even though the headset provides a jack for 4mm drivers Noise decided to ship 3.5mm drivers instead -- what a shame! Some notable points:- The cushions are soft. I have big ears and surprisingly it fits my ears completely :)- It doesn't give room for people with a turban or a scarf on their head. It is a little restrictive in terms of being wide.- Your ears will sweat if you wear it for as little as 1 hour.- The plastic quality looks durable and has a smooth matt finish too.- The buttons have a nice light click to them.- It looks and feels premium at this price range.- The mic audio for calling is not very clear. IT WORKS FINE though- The Bluetooth range is decent too,RTGJZ6RAZT4XS,12,Everything Works Except Auxiliary Mode :(,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RTGJZ6RAZT4XS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CY2377YW,1020,530,Colour: Space Blue

2024-06-23,B0CQ4KTCH1,4,"The product looks amazing and fits perfectly. You get a tool inside the box for adjusting the strap length according to your convenience. The battery backup is good (but not 7 days as advertised, it's like 3 to 4 days max. on average use). I don't use it for fitness tracking, so I won't say much about that, but it has a lot of those features though. Bluetooth calling is great, very good sound and mic quality for a watch. Overall, a 4 out of 5 for the watch.Now when it comes to the app associated with it, which is the NoiseFit app, it sucks a bit. I had continuous connectivity issues from the beginning. The initial setup somehow works fine, but once you get disconnected from Bluetooth, it is impossible to reconnect again (at least on my phone). The only way to reconnect is to unpair from the app (which also doesn't work), unpair the watch from your device settings, reset the watch, uninstall the app, again reinstall the app and start over everything again. Yes, that's what you have to do. And the customer service also sucks, why the hell do you need 3 WORKING DAYS to just respond to the complaint ticket? Even after responding they couldn't solve my issue for another 4 days. Then I just decided to give up on them and tried resetting my entire smartphone, and IT STILL DOESN'T GET SOLVED. So, I start over again and decided to never turn off Bluetooth. It's been fine until now at least. Overall app and customer service rating, 2 out of 5.",R1L9R7HCQ3VMSQ,12,The watch itself is great but the app sucks a bit.,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1L9R7HCQ3VMSQ?ASIN=B0CQ4KTCH1,23843,8403,Colour: Elite BlackSize: 1.4Style Name: Mettalix
2024-07-11,B0CQ4KTCH1,3,"I have been using the Noise Twist Go smartwatch for three months, and my experience has been a mixed bag. While there are a few features that stand out, several significant issues have impacted the overall usability and satisfaction with this device.Pros:1. Feature Set: The Noise Twist Go offers a decent range of features. It includes fitness tracking, notifications, and customizable watch faces, which are quite handy for everyday use.2. Design: The design is sleek and modern, making it a stylish accessory that fits well with both casual and formal attire.3. Battery Life: The battery life is fairly good, lasting several days on a single charge with moderate use.Cons:1. Wrist Sensors: One of the major drawbacks is the wrist sensors. They do not work as accurately as needed. Whether it’s tracking my heart rate or other fitness metrics, the readings are often inconsistent and unreliable. This undermines one of the primary reasons for having a smartwatch.2. Wake-Up Function: The watch wakes up even with the slightest movement. This results in unnecessary battery drain and can be quite annoying, especially during sleep when the screen lights up with every minor movement.3. Automatic Reboots: The most frustrating issue is that the watch turns off and on repeatedly. This problem persists despite several attempts to reset and troubleshoot the device.

2024-06-27,B0BJ73KHKJ,4,"So from the start of my purchase story for noise colourfit twist was that I bought this product in Jan 12 2024 , after my purchase I used this watch for 6 complete months and to be honest I was really very happy with the performance of this watch. Now after roughly some random day to day use like any person can actually do , this watch can be more than enough for your lifestyle but someone with some lifestyle specially any one who is sporty or sturdy just (like I am ) should think once before taking this because this is very slick in design and may cause sweat more on your wrist which can also damage from straps , screen has good brightness in morning and in evening , spo2 sescor are also accurate .

2024-02-16,B0B217Z5VK,1,"Title: Disappointing Experience with Noise Buds 402**Introduction:**As an avid music lover and frequent user of earbuds, I was excited to try out the Noise Buds 402. However, my experience with these earbuds left much to be desired.**Product Overview:**The Noise Buds 402 are marketed as affordable wireless earbuds with decent sound quality and convenient features such as touch controls and a compact charging case.**Specific Issues Encountered:**Unfortunately, I encountered several issues with these earbuds that made using them a frustrating experience.**Sound Quality:**The sound quality of the Noise Buds 402 is subpar at best. Despite claims of clear and crisp audio, I found the sound to be muffled and lacking in detail. The bass was particularly weak, making music sound flat and unexciting.**Build Quality:**The build quality of the earbuds themselves also left much to be desired. They felt cheaply made and flimsy, with the plastic casing showing signs of wear after only a few uses. Additionally, the earbuds would occasionally disconnect from each other, disrupting my listening experience.**Battery Life:**While the battery life of the Noise Buds 402 is decent, lasting around 4-5 hours on a single charge, it falls short of the advertised 6-hour battery life. Moreover, the charging case provided only one additional charge, limiting the overall usage time when on the go.**Connectivity Issues:**I experienced frequent connectivity issues with these earbuds, with the Bluetooth connection dropping out intermittently, even when my device was in close proximity. This made it impossible to enjoy music or take calls without constant interruptions.**Conclusion:**In conclusion, I cannot recommend the Noise Buds 402 to others based on my experience. The subpar sound quality, flimsy build, short battery life, and connectivity issues make these earbuds a poor investment. I would advise potential buyers to look elsewhere for a more reliable and higher-quality buds any Brand,, Money Never comes Easley,,,,",R1ZXINLJB8V1ES,28,"its very cheep quality Technicalities, its not worthy of money its suitable for  RS 599/- Only",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZXINLJB8V1ES?ASIN=B0B217Z5VK,10973,3648,Colour: Neon WhiteStyle Name: Buds VS402

2024-08-01,B0CG1Y3336,5,"I have been thinking about getting a new watch for a while and honestly, I had never bought a nice one for myself. I was not a huge fan of Noise products but was impressed with their recent launches. I read many reviews and loved how this particular watch had so many variants and options.I got the watch in less than 24 hours of my ordering and delighted to receive it! The watch is just what I was looking for and perfect for my use. It's trendy, smart and useful. The features it has would be helpful like period tracking, remote camera, calculator, quick access to messages and weather. And I love that it has Find My Phone option too. I can change music from the watch too. Basically, it offers just what a regular person needs + some special features for women. It looks premium and is priced right, was happy to get some discount on Amazon. And yes, they provided a proper manual for the watch + size adjusting instructions and tool. It was VERY helpful as it was loose for me, and had to be adjusted as per my wrist size. Overall, I highly recommend this product for someone looking for a smart watch, that's not too bulky, offers the right set of features and is not crazy expensive.
